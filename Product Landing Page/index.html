      <h2>Overall Finish</h2>
      <p>The overall finish of guitars reflects meticulous craftsmanship, enhancing both their beauty and sound.</p>

      <h2>String Action</h2>
      <p>String action on a guitar refers to the height of the strings above the fretboard. It plays a crucial role in the playability and sound of the instrument.</p>

      <h2>Neck Alignment</h2>
      <p>To ensure perfect execution of the notes on your guitar, the neck must be perfectly straight with perfectly leveled frets. In our quality control we make sure that this is the case, checking the guitar fingerboard from top to bottom.

      <h2>Correct Tunning</h2>
      <p>A good guitar has to tune well on all the notes of the fretboard. That is another of the checks we do with your guitar. In this way, we play a little bit. Everything can not be work.</p>

      <h2>Balance Sound</h2>
      <p>A good guitar has to have a good balance between low, mid and high sounds. Spanish guitars are famous for their balanced sound, but we make sure that it is always that way.</p>

      <h2>Eletroncis</h2>
      <p>Some of our guitars have some built-in electrification system. In these cases, we connect the guitar to an amplifier and check that everything works correctly, with a clean and balanced sound and without any unwanted noise.</p>

      <div class="level">Alhambra</div>
      <p class="guitar-desc">The Alhambra 2F Flamenco Guitar from Alhambra Guitars with its open-pore finish has a powerful and truly flamenco sound with just a tiny hint of crispness. Slightly brighter tone overall than a classical guitar. The action is very low and easy to play. Very suitable for moving quickly up and down the neck. The finish and craftsmanship are top-notch. With its solid cedar top, this is an instrument of great beauty. Alhambra guitars are known worldwide for the quality of their craftsmanship, and although this is a very reasonably-priced flamenco guitar, they have paid the same attention to detail with this model, also. Open-pore satin finish. With transparent pickguard. Electronics as an option. Alhambra gig bag included.<p>

      <div class="level">Prudencia</div>
      <p class="guitar-desc">The flamenco guitar Prudencio Saez 3-FL formerly model 37 is an exotic instrument, with a unique white ebony body. But this flamenco guitar is not only beautiful; it's also a great sounding guitar with plenty of attack and an authentic flamenco tone. Like a good flamenco guitar, the action of the strings is low and this makes the guitar very comfortable to play. The sound board of the Prudencio Saez 3-FL is made of solid spruce or solid cedar, the neck is made of cedar with a lovely ebony fingerboard. Vintage style bronze-coloured tuning machines. With pick guard. Gig bag included.<p>
