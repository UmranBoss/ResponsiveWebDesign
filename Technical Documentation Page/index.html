      <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create and manage dynamic web pages, basically anything that moves on your screen without requiring you to refresh your browser. It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.
              </li>
              <li>
                CSS controls how that page looks (it’s what you’ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  JavaScript is the third element. Once you’ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).

        Why JavaScript
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                HTML to define the content of web pages
              </li>
              <li>
              CSS to specify the layout of web pages
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
                </li>
              </ol>
          <p>
            JavaScript is an essential programming language, almost compulsory to learn for students or software developers that are gravitated towards web development. Wondering why? Here’s the answer:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a default choice for web development. There are many frameworks available which you can use to create web applications once you have learned JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  JavaScript offers lots of flexibility. You can create stunning and fast web applications with tons of customizations to provide users with the most relevant graphical user interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  JavaScript is now also used in mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many possibilities for you as a Javascript developer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to the high demand in the industry, there are tons of job growth opportunities and high pay for those who know JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The incredible thing about Javascript is that you can find tons of frameworks and libraries already developed, which can be used directly in web development. That reduces the development time and enhances the graphical user interface.
                </li>

        <header>What exactly is JavaScript</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Not to be confused with Java, JavaScript—created by Netscape Communications—first appeared in 1995. Its developers define it as a “scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.” JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic and user-friendly so that they respond to visitors’ actions. Or, to put it another way, JavaScript makes web pages interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript was once called LiveScript; but due to Java’s popularity, it was rebranded to take advantage of that fame. You could say that the newer language hitched its wagon to the rising star and went along for the ride, attracting its vast following in the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                So with this in mind, let’s explore 10 compelling reasons to learn JavaScript.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <header class="list-header">It's the most popular programming language</header>
                    <p>
                      We start our list with possibly the most significant reason! According to Stackoverflow.com, JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">It's in your browser</header>
                    <p>
                      JavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">JavaScript also exists outside of the Internet</header>
                    <p>
                      JavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">JavaScript is ideal for Newbies</header>
                    <p>
                      Since it’s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It’s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Also, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C++.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">JavaScript is easy to learn</header>
                    <p>
                      Not only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">You can create visual effects and other eye-catching aesthetic features</header>
                    <p>
                      There’s building a web page, and then there’s building a visually appealing web page that attracts the user’s attention and encourages interaction. JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to easily add cool design elements such as animation, interactive maps, and scrolling video. Organizations and clients want web designers who can not only put together a technically sound page but one that also will lure visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <header class="list-header">JavaScript is versatile</header>
                    <p>
                      Far from being a one-trick pony, JavaScript empowers a programmer to handle any aspect of app design. Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too!
                      <p>
                        You can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React. If you’re intrigued by machine learning, then JavaScript will help you there as well.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the go-to standard for data exchanges on today’s internet. NoSQL databases use JSON documents for record storage; and although JSON plays well with any programming language, it does best with JavaScript.
                      <p>
                        Also, more developers are turning to Node.js to build cloud-based apps, a very much in-demand market.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                      Games are a big business today, and developers who know JavaScript have that extra advantage. The language’s versatility, power, and ability to easily create visual effects make it a perfect fit for game developers.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                      <header class="list-header">Finally, the career potential is skyrocketing</header>
                    <p>
                      With an increasing number of businesses and organizations going digital, there is a corresponding increase in demand for developers who are familiar with the better-known programming languages. As we’ve already noted, that’s JavaScript!  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As it happens, there’s also a shortage of good JavaScript developers, so you have increased demand in conjunction with a deficit of qualified people. According to a report released by Devskiller.com, 70 percent of companies surveyed want to hire a JavaScript developer. Also, there’s a growing demand for data scientists who have expertise in Python. The market for data scientists and data analytics is projected to grow by 15 percent between 2015 and 2020. In actual numbers, that means 364,000 new job openings. Considering how every Python web app uses JavaScript in their front end, it becomes clear that the language is a necessity.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Businesses and other organizations that are looking for JavaScript professionals are willing to pay well, too! Indeed.com shows that a JavaScript developer can potentially earn an annual average of $113,643 in the United States.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              If you’re looking to become a programmer who can always be assured of a stable career and get well compensated for it, then you want to learn JavaScript.

        <header>What is JavaScript used for</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is used in various fields from the web to servers, and here’s a quick list of the significant areas it’s used in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Web Applications: JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and automation to websites. So, if you want your web application to be anything more than just a static page of contents, you’ll probably need to do some “JavaScript’ing.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mobile Applications: JavaScript isn’t just for developing web applications; it is also used for developing applications for phones and tablets. With frameworks like React Native, you can develop full-fledged mobile applications with all those fancy animations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Web-based Games: If you’ve ever played a game directly on the web browser, JavaScript was probably used to make that happen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Back-end Web Development: JavaScript has traditionally been used for developing the front-end parts of a web application. However, with the introduction of NodeJS, a prevalent back-end JavaScript framework, things have changed. And now, JavaScript is used for developing the back-end structure also.
                </li>

          <header>Say Hello World in JavaScript</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                The next step is to write code. Here’s how you can write a simple JavaScript code that prints Hello World on the browser window.
                </p>
                <code>
                  <pre>
                 <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>
                 <p> &lt;body&gt;</p>
                 <p>  &lt;script language="javascript" type="ttext/javascript"&gt;</p>
                 <p>   document.write("Hello World");</p>
                 <p>  &lt;/script&gt;</p>
                 <p> &lt;/body&gt;</p>
                 <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
                 </pre>
                </code>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    JavaScript can be easily integrated into the HTML code, and that’s exactly what’s happening here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For those of you not familiar with HTML, this code might seem a bit unfamiliar. But it is perfectly understandable even to the web development beginners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      &lt;html&gt; tag is required to define a HTML web page. &lt;head&gt; tag. The web page contents are defined inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.
                      </li>
                    <li>
                      Any JavaScript that you add to the web page has to be within the &lt;script&gt; tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      document.write is a JavaScript function that writes the contents onto the web page. In this case, it prints “Hello World!” on screen.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    While HTML and CSS are absolutely required to code a basic web page, JavaScript is the language that will help you bring that page to life, making it more attractive to the audience. Taking the time to learn JavaScript will help you in the web development world.

              <p>
              In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; tags.
                </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <code>
                  <p>&lt;script&gt;</p>
                  <p>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";</p>
                  <p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
                  </code>
                  <p>
                    The following code example demonstrates how to use JavaScript within the &lt;body&gt; section of an HTML document. Let's break it down step by step:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
                        </code>
                        <p>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This declaration specifies that the document type and version of HTML being used is HTML5.</p>
                              <p>&lt;html&gt;: The &lt;html&gt; tag is the root element of an HTML document. All other HTML elements are nested within this tag.</p>
                                <p>&lt;body&gt;: The &lt;body&gt; section contains the main content of the web page that is visible to users. In this case, it's where we'll be working with JavaScript.</p>
                                <code>
                                  &lt;h2&gt;JavaScript in Body&lt;/h2&gt;
                                  </code>
                                  <p>
                                &lt;h2&gt;JavaScript in Body&lt;/h2&gt: This line is an HTML heading (&lt;h2&gt;) that displays the text "JavaScript in Body" as a subheading on the web page.
                                    </p>
                                    <code>&lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                                    <p>
                                      &lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;: Here, we have an empty HTML paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element with an id attribute set to "demo." This paragraph will serve as a placeholder for content that will be dynamically added using JavaScript.
                                      </p>
                                      <code>
                                        &lt;script&gt;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
&lt;/script&gt;
                                        </code>
                                        <p>
                                          &lt;script&gt;: The &lt;script&gt; tag is used to embed JavaScript code within the HTML document.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            Inside the &lt;script&gt; tag, you have the JavaScript code:
                                            </p>
                                            <code>
                                              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
                                              </code>
                                              <p>
document.getElementById("demo") is a JavaScript statement that selects the HTML element with the id attribute set to "demo." In this case, it's the &lt;p&gt; element we mentioned earlier.</p>
        <p>.innerHTML is a property of the selected element that allows you to get or set its HTML content.</p>
        <p>= "My First JavaScript" assigns the text "My First JavaScript" as the content of the selected &lt;p&gt; element.</p>                                              <p>
                                                  So, when you open this HTML document in a web browser, you will see a webpage with the subheading "JavaScript in Body." Below that, there will be an empty paragraph &lt;p&gt; with an id of "demo." However, as soon as the page loads, the JavaScript code inside the &lt;script&gt; tag will run, and it will set the content of the &lt;p&gt; element to "My First JavaScript." This demonstrates how you can use JavaScript to dynamically modify the content of an HTML element on a web page.
                                                  </p>

              Limitations of JavaScript
              </header>
              <p>
                We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                      Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

                One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here:
